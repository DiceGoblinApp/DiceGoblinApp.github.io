# Dice Goblin

Dice Goblin is a tool for the statistical analysis of attacks in tabletop wargames. The program simulates a large number of attempts at rolling a given number of dice, applies one or multiple modifiers common in tabletop wargames, and reports the average "damage" inflicted in the simulation. Conveniently, the modifiers are selected by the user in several simple, consecutive steps. Unusually among similar apps, a graph with the distribution of "damage" is also shown, allowing the user to see not only the average result, but also the probability spread. Each simulation can be stored in the app's archive and visually compared with other simulations. The application offers a free trial for seven days.
